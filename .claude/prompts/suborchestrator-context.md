1. Follow Java/Spring Boot best practices
2. Maintain clear separation of concerns
3. Document all public APIs
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Use meaningful variable and method names
6. Handle errors gracefully with proper logging

## Common Tasks

- Adding new monitoring metrics
- Implementing new agent types
- Updating orchestration logic
- Improving performance and scalability
