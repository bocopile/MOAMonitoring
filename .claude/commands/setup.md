description: Set up the development environment and install dependencies
---

Please help me set up the development environment:

1. Check for required build files (pom.xml, build.gradle, package.json, etc.)
2. Identify the project type and runtime requirements
3. Install necessary dependencies
4. Verify the setup is complete
5. Provide instructions for running the project

Make sure to check for any configuration files that need to be created.
