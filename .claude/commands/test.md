Please run the project tests:

1. Find and identify the test framework being used
2. Run all tests
3. Report any failures with detailed error messages
4. Suggest fixes for failing tests if any
5. Provide a summary of test coverage if available

Make sure to run both unit tests and integration tests if they exist.
